## Area of a Trapezium
A trapezium is a quadrilateral that has only one pair of parallel sides.
To calculate the area of a trapezium, divide it into a rectangle and two triangles as shown below.

#### Terminology
Now, piece together the triangular ends so that the trapezium is divided into a triangle and rectangle.  The base of the triangle is the difference between the lengths of two parallel sides.  That is, a â€“ b.

A trapezium whose parallel sides are of length a units and b units and the perpendicular distance between them is h units has an area of A square units given by the formula

Area of Trapezium = Area of Rectangle + Area of Triangle
                  = bh + 1/2(a-b)h
                  = h[b + 1/2(a-b)]
                  = h[2b/2 + (a-b)/2]
                  = h[(2b+a-b)/2]
                  = h[(a + b)/2]
                  = [Half the sum of parallel sides] * [Perpendicular distance between the parallel sides]
                    
#### Examples
a = 20 units , b = 14 units, h = 12 units, A = 1/2(a+b)h = 204 square units
a = 8.8 units , b = 4.2 units, h = 6 units, A = 1/2(a+b)h = 39 square units
